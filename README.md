# Learn Elixir with Tests

- This is an adaption of [Learning Go with Tests by Chris James](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/). Check it out, one of the coolest and funnest learning experiences I've ever done.

## Why

- Explore the Elixir language by writing tests
- **Get a grounding with TDD**. Elixir is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and has a built in testing framework
- Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Elixir

## Table of contents

### Elixir fundamentals

1. [Install Elixir](install-elixir.md) - Set up the environment for productivity.
2. [Hello, world](hello-world.md) - Declaring variables, constants, if/else statements, switch, write your first elixir program and write your first test. Sub-test syntax and closures.
